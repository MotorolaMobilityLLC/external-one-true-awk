============================

A semi-random list of things to look into.

1. DONE. Make sure the FIXES file has everything after the date order
was reversed.

2. DONE. Look into the problem that NF-- doesn't throw away the last field.
This a long-standing issue.

3. DONE. Add suport for %a and %A printf formats.

4. DONE. Look into the problem that string conversions are sticky; once
done they never change, even if OFMT or CONVFMT do. Similarly, a
conversion from OFMT becomes the permanent string value, which is
incorrect.

5. MAYBE: Improve the test suite enough so that it can be cleaned up after
it was run, and old results can be saved for comparison.
